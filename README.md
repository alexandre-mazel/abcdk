Abcdk stand for Advanced Behavior Complementary Development Kit for NAOqi robots

This is a legacy from my work (and some of my team) at Aldebaran-Robotics then SoftBank/Robotics for 14 years.

Please free to use it as real documentation sample, howtos and lazy functionality.

Don't expect everything to work, to be documented nor to be pep8.

And more over, don't expect any support from me or the original company.


The original purpose was to have an over-layer enabling same working code for NAO, Romeo and Pepper, and to hide all the annoying API changes after each official new released version.
