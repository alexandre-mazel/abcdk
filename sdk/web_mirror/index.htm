About The Aldebaran Behavior Complementary Development Kit<br>
<br>
Nearly all the delivered boxes of the NaoLabs use the ABCD kit.<br>
It's a non official small sofware layer we develop to help the studio develop high-end application, helping maintenance and performance:<br>
<br>
To avoid duplicate code and to load behavior faster, the whole part of the code is put on some external python code. <br>
<br>
Those files are copied once on the robot, and then used by all our boxes, so even if you want to copy-paste some boxes at different part of one behavior or in a lot of different behaviors,
your behaviors will remain light and easy to maintain, as all the modification we should have to made would only affect the abcdk files and not your behaviors.<br>
<br>
This kit is intended to evolve but a strong attention to backward compatibility will be made, so a behavior working with one version will continue to work on a future one.<br>
<br>
You can install this kit on your robot by launching the behavior abcdk_installer.crg, you only have to do this one time.<br>
